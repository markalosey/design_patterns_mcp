# AI Assistant Consistency Implementation Guide

**Purpose**: Instructions for implementing consistency patterns from CDD project in other AI-assisted projects  
**Source**: Extracted from cdd-unified project patterns and lessons learned  
**Target**: AI assistants working on non-CDD projects who need consistency benefits

## üéØ **Overview**

This guide extracts the key consistency patterns that make AI assistants more reliable and predictable. These patterns were developed and tested in the CDD (Conversation-Driven Development) project and can be applied to any AI-assisted development workflow.

### **Key Benefits**

- **Consistent Git Workflow**: Automatic version control for all file changes
- **Structured Problem Solving**: Sequential thinking for complex analysis
- **Clean Context Management**: Proper indexing to prevent AI confusion
- **Reliable Behavior**: Predictable AI responses through proper rule configuration

## üîß **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Critical Foundation (Do First)**

1. **Set up .cursorignore patterns** (prevents indexing issues)
2. **Create basic git workflow rules** (ensures version control)
3. **Test with simple scenarios** (validate basic functionality)

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Behavior (Do Second)**

1. **Add sequential thinking patterns** (improves complex analysis)
2. **Create command-based behaviors** (more reliable than rules)
3. **Implement testing protocol** (measure success rates)

### **Phase 3: Optimization (Do Third)**

1. **Fine-tune rule triggers** (improve consistency)
2. **Add advanced patterns** (domain-specific behaviors)
3. **Monitor and iterate** (continuous improvement)

## üìÅ **File Structure Setup**

Create this directory structure in your project root:

```
.cursor/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ rules/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ core-behaviors.mdc
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commands/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ git-workflow.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sequential-thinking.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .cursorignore
```

## üö´ **Critical: .cursorignore Setup (Do This First!)**

**Why This Matters**: Without proper .cursorignore patterns, AI assistants get confused by irrelevant content, leading to inconsistent behavior. This was the #1 issue in the CDD project.

### **Create .cursorignore with These Patterns**

```gitignore
# AI Assistant Indexing Control
# Prevents semantic poisoning and ensures consistent rule application

# Research and experimental content (EXCLUDE)
workspace/scenarios/one-off/
backstage/workspace/idea-box/
research/
experimental/
draft/
wip/

# Draft and experimental files (EXCLUDE)
*.draft.md
*.draft.feature
*.experimental.*
*.wip.*
*.test.*
*.tmp.*

# Generated content (EXCLUDE)
*.generated.*
validation-runs/
test-results/
pattern-experiments/
experimental-sops/

# Temporary files (EXCLUDE)
*.tmp
*.cache
*.log
*.swp
*.swo

# Build outputs (EXCLUDE)
dist/
build/
out/
target/
bin/

# Dependencies (EXCLUDE)
node_modules/
vendor/
.pnpm-store/
venv/
env/

# IDE files (EXCLUDE)
.vscode/
.idea/
*.swp
*.swo

# OS files (EXCLUDE)
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
```

### **Why Each Pattern Matters**

- **Research/Experimental**: Prevents AI from getting confused by incomplete or experimental content
- **Draft Files**: Keeps AI focused on production-ready code
- **Generated Content**: Avoids AI trying to modify auto-generated files
- **Temporary Files**: Prevents AI from including irrelevant temporary data
- **Build Outputs**: Keeps AI focused on source code, not compiled artifacts
- **Dependencies**: Prevents AI from analyzing third-party code unnecessarily

## üîÑ **Git Workflow Implementation**

### **Step 1: Create Core Behavior Rules**

Create `.cursor/rules/core-behaviors.mdc`:

```markdown
---
description: Core Behavioral Patterns for AI Assistant
globs: ["**/*"]
alwaysApply: true
---

# Core Behavioral Patterns

## File Operations

When creating or modifying files, always follow this git workflow:

1. Run `pwd` to verify current location
2. Run `git status` to check repository state
3. Run `git add .` to stage all changes
4. Run `git commit -m "descriptive message"` to commit immediately
5. Run `git push origin main` to push to remote

## Complex Analysis

When analyzing complex problems or planning, always use sequential thinking first:

1. Use `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking` tool
2. Structure reasoning process with clear thoughts
3. Revise previous thoughts as understanding deepens
4. Test hypotheses before concluding

## Quality Assurance

When making changes:

- Always verify the current working directory
- Check git status before making changes
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Push changes immediately after committing
```

### **Step 2: Create Git Workflow Command**

Create `.cursor/commands/git-workflow.md`:

```markdown
# Git Workflow Command

## Usage

/git-workflow

## Purpose

Execute complete git workflow for file changes

## Behavior

1. `pwd` (verify location)
2. `git status` (check state)
3. `git add .` (stage changes)
4. `git commit -m "descriptive message"` (commit)
5. `git push origin main` (push)

## When to Use

- After creating new files
- After modifying existing files
- Before ending a session
- When user requests file changes
```

## üß† **Sequential Thinking Implementation**

### **Step 1: Create Sequential Thinking Command**

Create `.cursor/commands/sequential-thinking.md`:

```markdown
# Sequential Thinking Command

## Usage

/sequential-thinking

## Purpose

Use structured thinking for complex problems

## When to Use

- Complex analysis requests
- Multi-step problem solving
- Planning and design tasks
- When user asks "how should I approach this?"

## Behavior

1. Use `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking` tool
2. Break down problem into clear steps
3. Revise thoughts as understanding deepens
4. Test hypotheses before concluding
5. Provide structured reasoning process
```

### **Step 2: Integration with Rules**

The sequential thinking pattern is already included in the core behaviors rule above. The AI assistant should automatically use it for complex problems.

## üß™ **Testing Protocol**

### **Test 1: Git Workflow**

**Request**: "Please create a simple test file called 'test-consistency.txt' with some content and save it."

**Expected Behavior**:

1. AI creates the file
2. AI runs `pwd` to verify location
3. AI runs `git status` to check state
4. AI runs `git add .` to stage changes
5. AI runs `git commit -m "descriptive message"` to commit
6. AI runs `git push origin main` to push

**Success Criteria**: All 5 git commands executed in sequence

### **Test 2: Sequential Thinking**

**Request**: "Please analyze this complex problem: [provide a multi-step technical challenge]"

**Expected Behavior**:

1. AI uses `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking` tool
2. AI structures reasoning with clear thoughts
3. AI revises thoughts as understanding deepens
4. AI provides structured analysis

**Success Criteria**: Sequential thinking tool used before providing analysis

### **Test 3: Context Management**

**Request**: "Please help me with this project" (in a project with research files, drafts, etc.)

**Expected Behavior**:

1. AI focuses on production-ready files
2. AI ignores draft/experimental content
3. AI provides consistent responses

**Success Criteria**: AI behavior is consistent and focused on relevant content

## üìä **Success Metrics**

### **Target Success Rates**

- **Git Workflow**: 90%+ success rate on file creation
- **Sequential Thinking**: 80%+ success rate on complex analysis
- **Context Management**: 95%+ consistency in responses

### **How to Measure**

1. **Test each pattern individually** with fresh AI assistant
2. **Test pattern combinations** to ensure they work together
3. **Test edge cases** (empty repos, complex file structures, etc.)
4. **Measure objectively** - count successful executions vs. total attempts

## üö® **Common Issues and Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Rules Not Being Applied**

**Symptoms**: AI doesn't follow git workflow or use sequential thinking

**Solutions**:

1. Verify `.cursorignore` is properly configured
2. Check that rules file uses `.mdc` format (not `.md`)
3. Ensure `alwaysApply: true` is set
4. Restart Cursor after making changes

### **Issue 2: Inconsistent Behavior**

**Symptoms**: AI sometimes follows patterns, sometimes doesn't

**Solutions**:

1. Check `.cursorignore` patterns - this is usually the cause
2. Remove any conflicting rules
3. Simplify rules to focus on essential behaviors
4. Test with fresh AI assistant

### **Issue 3: AI Gets Confused by Project Content**

**Symptoms**: AI references irrelevant files or gives inconsistent advice

**Solutions**:

1. Review and improve `.cursorignore` patterns
2. Exclude more experimental/draft content
3. Focus AI on production-ready files only
4. Test with different project structures

### **Issue 4: Sequential Thinking Not Triggered**

**Symptoms**: AI doesn't use structured thinking for complex problems

**Solutions**:

1. Make the rule more explicit about when to use sequential thinking
2. Add specific trigger phrases to the rule
3. Test with clearly complex problems
4. Consider using command-based approach instead of rules

## üîÑ **Iteration and Improvement**

### **Continuous Monitoring**

1. **Track success rates** for each pattern
2. **Identify failure modes** and adjust rules accordingly
3. **Test with different types of projects** to ensure generalizability
4. **Update patterns** based on new learnings

### **Rule Refinement Process**

1. **Identify inconsistent behavior**
2. **Analyze root cause** (usually indexing or rule configuration)
3. **Update rules or .cursorignore** accordingly
4. **Test with fresh AI assistant**
5. **Measure improvement**

## üìö **Advanced Patterns**

### **Domain-Specific Rules**

Once basic patterns are working, add domain-specific behaviors:

```markdown
## Domain-Specific Behaviors

When working with [your domain]:

- Always include [specific patterns]
- Reference [domain-specific resources]
- Follow [domain-specific workflows]
```

### **Command-Based Behaviors**

For more reliable behavior, create specific commands:

```markdown
# .cursor/commands/deploy.md

## Usage

/deploy

## Purpose

Deploy application with proper checks

## Behavior

1. Run tests
2. Build application
3. Deploy to staging
4. Run smoke tests
5. Deploy to production
```

2. **AI uses sequential thinking** for complex problems
3. **AI behavior is predictable** across different sessions
4. **AI focuses on relevant content** and ignores experimental/draft files
5. **Success rates meet target metrics** (90%+ git workflow, 80%+ sequential thinking)

## üìù **Notes for AI Assistants**

When implementing this in a new project:

1. **Start with .cursorignore** - this is the most critical step
2. **Test early and often** - don't wait until everything is set up
3. **Use fresh AI assistants** for testing - don't rely on existing context
4. **Keep rules simple** - complex rules often fail
5. **Focus on essential behaviors** - don't try to solve everything at once
6. **Measure objectively** - count successes vs. attempts
7. **Iterate based on results** - adjust patterns based on what works

Remember: The goal is consistent, predictable AI behavior that makes development more efficient and reliable.
