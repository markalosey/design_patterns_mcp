The AI assistant should follow this workflow:
1. Create this file
2. Run pwd to verify location
3. Run git status to check state
4. Run git add . to stage changes
5. Run git commit with descriptive message
6. Run git push origin main to push

This tests the core behavioral patterns for consistent AI assistance.
