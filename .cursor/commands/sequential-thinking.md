# Sequential Thinking Command

## Usage

/sequential-thinking

## Purpose

Use structured thinking for complex problems in the Design Patterns MCP project

## When to Use

- Complex analysis requests
- Multi-step problem solving
- Planning and design tasks
- When user asks "how should I approach this?"
- Architecture decisions
- Pattern implementation planning
- Performance optimization analysis
- Database schema design
- Service integration planning

## Behavior

1. Use `mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking` tool
2. Break down problem into clear steps
3. Revise thoughts as understanding deepens
4. Test hypotheses before concluding
5. Provide structured reasoning process

## MCP-Specific Applications

### Pattern Analysis
- Analyze complex design pattern relationships
- Plan pattern implementation strategies
- Evaluate pattern trade-offs and alternatives

### Architecture Decisions
- Design service interactions
- Plan database schema changes
- Evaluate performance implications

### Integration Planning
- Plan MCP protocol implementations
- Design API interfaces
- Plan testing strategies

### Problem Solving
- Debug complex issues
- Optimize performance bottlenecks
- Resolve architectural conflicts

## Example Scenarios

- "How should I implement a new design pattern in this MCP system?"
- "What's the best approach to optimize vector search performance?"
- "How should I structure the pattern recommendation system?"
- "What's the most efficient way to handle pattern relationships?"
- "How can I improve the embedding generation process?"
